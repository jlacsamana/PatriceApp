# Patrice - A Boolean Logic Visualizer

## What it does
This program will generate visualizations of boolean logic statements given a 
valid input from the user or generates a logical statement from a corresponding
valid visualization created by the user.

Visualizations will be in the form of interactive logical circuits, 
consisting of inputs, gates and outputs.


## Who's it for
The following groups of people might find some utility in this application:
- nerds

## Why I chose to make this
It seemed like a cool idea for a final project for a University CS class

I named the program in honour of Dr. Patrice Belleville

# Patrice - A Boolean Logic Visualizer

## What it does
This program will generate visualizations of boolean logic statements given a 
valid input from the user or generates a logical statement from a corresponding
valid visualization created by the user.

Visualizations will be in the form of interactive logical circuits, 
consisting of inputs, gates and outputs.


## Who's it for
The following groups of people might find some utility in this application:
- Struggling CPSC 121 Students
- Patrice Belleville himself hopefully, and other CPSC 121 Lecturers
- Students enrolled in other classes that involve boolean logic(PHIL 220)

## Why I chose to make this
CPSC 121 isn't easy at the start. They introduce concepts that most people
haven't had any experience with. The section on boolean logic was particularly
difficult to grasp, in my opinion. Visualization can go a long way in helping 
those who are having the most trouble with the early part of the course. 

I named the program in honour of Dr. Patrice Belleville, who made CPSC 121
a thoroughly more enjoyeable experience. <br> <br>

##User Stories
- As a user,  I want to be able to write a boolean logical statement 
and have the program generate the correct corresponding logical circuit
- As a user, I want to be able to design my own logical circuit and have 
the program generate the correct corresponding logical statement.
- (OPTIONAL): As a user I want to be able to switch between the two above
activites and still recieve a properly generated logical statement or it's 
representation as a logical circuit
